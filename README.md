This paper evaluates various machine learning techniques and presents a novel strategy to address current challenges in diabetes prediction within the healthcare domain. The objective is to enhance the understanding of diabetes prediction and its progress in healthcare. The advantages and disadvantages of machine learning in addressing diabetes are discussed, emphasizing its potential for accurate disease prediction and automated diagnosis under professional validation.

In my study, I utilized the Dataspell IDE to implement diverse machine learning models for diabetes prediction, including Fully Connected Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classification, Naive Bayes Classification, Simple CART, XGBoost, and CATboost. The performance evaluation metrics encompass Accuracy, True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, Precision, Recall, and F-Measure.

The accuracy of the models varied, with the lowest at 68.83% (XGBoost) and the highest at 76.62% (Naive Bayes). Simple CART achieved the highest True Positive Rate (Recall) at 72.73%, while K-Nearest Neighbours had the lowest at 50.91%. Support Vector Machine exhibited the lowest False Positive Rate at 18.18%, whereas XGBoost had the highest at 29.29%. In terms of Precision, Support Vector Machine showed the highest at 66.67%, with XGBoost having the lowest at 55.38%. Naive Bayes attained the highest F-Measure at 68.42%, while K-Nearest Neighbours achieved the lowest at 55.45%.
